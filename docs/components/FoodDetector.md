# FoodDetector Component

The `FoodDetector` component is designed to utilize the device's camera to detect food items in real-time using a TensorFlow Lite model. It integrates with React Native's camera and TensorFlow Lite for object detection.

## Features

- **Camera Access**: Utilizes the device's back camera to stream video data.
- **TensorFlow Lite Model**: Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for detecting food items in the camera feed.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes frames in real-time to identify food items.
- **State Management**: Manages detection sessions and results using a Redux-like state management pattern.

## Usage

To use the `FoodDetector` component, simply import it into your React Native application and include it in your component tree:

```jsx
import FoodDetector from './path/to/FoodDetector';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FoodDetector />
  );
};
